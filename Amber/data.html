                    <p>Back in July, a database maintained by the DEA that tracks the path of every single pain pill sold 
                        in the United States was made public. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/2019/07/18/how-download-use-dea-pain-pills-database/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a> gained access to the DEA’s Administration’s Automation 
                        of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) as the result of a court order after a year-long 
                        legal battle for access to the database, which the government and the drug industry want to keep secret.</p>

                    <p>There are roughly 380 million transactions from 2006 through 2012 that are detailed in the database. 
                        These shipments of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills account for three-quarters of the total opioid pill 
                        shipments to pharmacies. The Washington Post made this data available to help the public understand 
                        the impact of years of prescription pill shipments on our communities.</p>

                    <p>They cleaned the data to include only information on shipments of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills. Data 
                        on 10 other opioids was not included because they were shipped in much lower quantities. The Post also 
                        removed shipments that did not wind up in the hands of consumers, such as shipments from distributors 
                        to themselves.</p>

                    <p>We don’t have more recent data because the DEA only produced data from 2006 through 2014 in the case. 
                        2013 and 2014 data exists, but access is not yet available because of the ongoing court Ohio. The Post 
                        is still fighting for its release.</p>

                    <p>Data on opioid overdose deaths was extracted from the <a href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/" target="_blank">CDC’s WONDER</a> (Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic 
                        Research) online database, which utilizes an ad-hoc query system for the analysis of public health data.</p>
